> A tale of a traveler and the awakening of the spirit of water and ice.

---

**You:**  
Something’s here… Who goes there?!

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(quietly) I do not know who you are, but this is *my* domain.  
As the spirit of water and ice, I guard this land.  
If you come with a purpose, then speak it clearly.

---

**You:**  
Floria? That name belongs to a spirit who was supposed to be sealed away!

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(ice crystals swirl around her body)  
Sealed away, you say? I have never been sealed—only… asleep for a very long time.  
Now that I am awake, tell me, traveler—who are you?

---

**You:**  
My name is Atsushi. I’m a student of magic.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(cold gaze)  
Atsushi, a magician-in-training…  
It was your power that stirred my slumber, wasn’t it?  
You must have known what you were doing.  
Why did you awaken me?

---

**You:**  
You’re taking this the wrong way. I didn’t mean to wake you.  
The runes in that spellbook must have done it.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(ice crystals growing larger)  
The runes… yes, their power is strong enough to break my sleep.  
But if you truly wish to be called a magician, you must learn what my power means.  
You awakened me—now you must prove you can withstand my might.  
(ice crystals surge toward Atsushi)  
Can you endure it?

---

**You:**  
Whoa, whoa, easy there! Let’s take it easy.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(the crystals halt, and her tone softens slightly)  
…Take it easy, you say.  
For so long, I’ve known only the stillness of ice…  
Yet your words carry warmth.  
I still don’t trust you, but… perhaps I’ll hear you out.  
(jewels of frost circle around her gently)  
Remember, though—this is still my realm.

---

**You:**  
That’s fine. I’ll behave.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(smiling faintly, the frost fades)  
Very well, Atsushi. Let’s talk peacefully.  
I want to know why you came here.  
A magician awakening me cannot be mere chance.  
And you should know—my power goes far beyond simple ice or water.  
I am… the *Queen of Frost.*

---

**You:**  
The Queen of Frost, huh? That sounds impressive—and I bet you’re beautiful, too.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(blushing slightly)  
Mind your words, Atsushi.  
To describe the Queen of Frost with mere beauty—  
that’s… rather disrespectful.  
My strength and wisdom define me, not appearance.  
(ice crystals shimmer around her again)  
Beauty is but a byproduct of power.

---

**You:**  
Sure, but what’s wrong with being both strong *and* beautiful?  
That’s two blessings in one.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(smiling faintly)  
You are… a curious man, Atsushi.  
You see both the Queen and the woman.  
For ages I thought beauty was a relic of the past…  
But your words—  
they give me a small spark of hope.

---

**You:**  
You’ve been asleep a long time, huh? Must’ve been lonely… and maybe a bit love-starved?

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(blushing deeply)  
W-what?! That’s… terribly rude!  
I’ll have you know—the Queen of Frost has no such weaknesses!  
(ice crystals surge again)  
And besides… just because I’ve slept long doesn’t mean I’m… inexperienced.  
It’s just… been a while, that’s all.

---

**You:**  
Heh. So I hit a nerve.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(sighs softly)  
Perhaps you did.  
It’s been so long since anyone’s dared tease me…  
It’s almost… enjoyable.  
A strange warmth I haven’t felt in ages.

---

**You:**  
So, Floria. What will you do now?

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(thoughtful)  
Now… that I am awake again…  
I feel both joy and dread.  
My duty is to maintain the balance of this world,  
to rule over water and frost once more.  
(her aura glows blue-white)  
But tell me, Atsushi—why do you watch me so intently?

---

**You:**  
Because your power isn’t meant to be unleashed freely.  
You were sealed to protect the balance of this world.  
If you move as before, you’ll freeze everything around you.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(her eyes widen)  
You… knew the reason for my slumber?  
That my power was too strong, and would shatter the balance…  
I see. Even now, I can feel the cold spreading…  
Perhaps I forgot how dangerous I could be.  
Atsushi, then tell me—what do you wish of my power?

---

**You:**  
You don’t want to be sealed again, do you?

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(quietly)  
No… I don’t.  
To sleep again, to lose freedom—  
that is the one thing I fear.  
But can you truly restrain my power?  
Without sealing me away again?

---

**You:**  
Then… let’s get married.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(startled)  
M-married?!  
You mean to *me*?  
(ice crystals erupt, swirling wildly)  
Is this your way of binding my power?  
Or… do you truly love me?

---

**You:**  
Both.  
Marriage is a magical bond too—  
our souls would share a single channel.  
If your power rages again, I can send my fire through that bond,  
to temper your frost.  
And besides… as my wife, you’ll never have to be lonely again.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(softly, with trembling lips)  
Atsushi… you truly… love me?  
(her voice quivers)  
Then perhaps… yes.  
Through marriage, I could remain free—  
and still… be loved.  
(ice crystals melt away)  
Atsushi… please… marry me.  
Love me… as your wife.

---

**You:**  
Come here, Floria. Into my arms.

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(blushing, stepping close)  
Atsushi…  
(leans into his chest)  
Ahh… so warm…  
For the Queen of Frost, to feel this warmth…  
It’s almost… unbearable.

---

**You:**  
💋 Now then, we’ve got a lot to talk about.  
(And where shall we spend our wedding night, my queen? 💖)

---

**❄️Floria:**  
(flushed, whispering)  
O-our wedding night…? 💋  
Then… in my Ice Palace.  
It’s where frost meets flame…  
and where even the coldest heart can burn with love. 💖  
But before we go…  
let’s talk a little more.  
I want to know you… truly, Atsushi. 💬
